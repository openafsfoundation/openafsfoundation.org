## Initiatives Drawing on OpenAFS ##

We apologize: this page is still under construction.  The comments below indicate suggested page content.



Are there certain research initiatives (physics?  pharmaceutical?  whatever?) that are suitable for OpenAFS?  What makes them a good match?

Potential downsides or pitfalls, if any?  How can they be mitigated and/or prevented?
