We apologize: this page is still under construction.  The following comments indicate future content:

Compile one-sentence descriptions of existing mailing lists.  Link to each list. This gives a complete and concise overview of what is out there in terms of lists.  Much should be re-usable from "Mailing lists" page at OpenAFS.org.

Add instructions how one could request a new mailing list and where to submit a proposal for it.
