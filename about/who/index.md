## Who We Are ##

The OpenAFS Foundation, Inc., is guided by our volunteer Board of Directors, a diverse
group of richly experienced individuals who agreed to volunteer for this
leadership challenge.  The Board of Directors has an Executive Director as its
head.  If you would like to learn about the individuals currently serving on
the [Board of Directors]({site.github.url}/board/).  The Board of
Directors is supported by volunteers who accepted the roles of **Treasurer** or
**Secretary**.  If you would like read a brief introduction to those volunteers,
click [here](XXXbrokenlink).

The Board of Directors oversees and has final authority over all activities
within The OpenAFS Foundation, Inc.  To help you understand our structure, we
composed an organizational chart which you can view [here](XXXbrokenlink).  The
chart will also offer definitions of the roles listed.

Among the OpenAFS Foundation's central values are fairness and transparency.
We believe that not only the lines of authority and the various tasks should be
disclosed, but also the financial status of the OpenAFS Foundation.  All moneys
were donated to the Foundation and its causes by individuals or organizations
wishing to support both our mission and our vision.  If you wish to peruse an
overview over our financials, click [here](XXXbrokenlink).  In addition, the
[Code of Ethics](XXXbrokenlink), the [Conflict of Interest
Policy](XXXbrokenlink), the [Wistleblower Protection Policy](XXXbrokenlink)
will aid you in understanding other core values of the OpenAFS Foundation. 

If you wish to contact the Board of Directors, please email
[foundation@openafs.org](mailto:foundation@openafs.org).  Should you wish to
contact specific Directors of the Board, you may find their email addresses
with their biographic introductions.  The Secretary can be contacted by

Treasurer will receive your emails to
