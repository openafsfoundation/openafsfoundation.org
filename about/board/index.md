## Our Volunteer Board Of Directors ##

The OpenAFS Foundation is being lead by a Board of Directors, consisting of
volunteers. Specific Board members also fill the roles of Executive Director
(who heads the board), Secretary, and Treasurer. Any new Board members must be
appointed by the existing Board.

The overview of the individual Directors on the Board below offers a brief summary of their relevant professional credentials.  The individuals are listed in alphabetical order by their last names.

### David Boldt (10/2014 - present) ###

David Boldt of the US Geological Survey (USGS) has been using AFS since 2001 as
part of a project to provide resilient web service which could survive the loss
of any single data center. A requirement was precipitated by a
hurricane-induced data center outage in Florida, which made USGS flood
information unavailable just when and where it was most needed. The USGS AFS
implementation replicates web content across data centers in Menlo Park
California, Sioux Falls South Dakota and Reston Virginia using a system of
programs which look for changes to AFS volumes and automatically `vos release`
on a 15 minute interval as required.

The experience of having a very small but dedicated team with a well-defined
objective, trying to make use of a broad variety of tools, including AFS,
engenders an appreciation for what OpenAFS provides. USGS could not have
provided the same user experience with any other product. David's resume is
that of a self-described technical generalist, starting as a hydrogeologist and
doing a bit of system administration, programming, system architecture, project
management, documentation, software training, web site production and customer
support over the years. He hopes to be able to contribute back to the OpenAFS
community with any and all of the skills he acquired on this career path.

David can be reached at <dboldt@usgs.gov>.

### Dave Botsch (10/2014 - present) ###

Dave Botsch is employed by the Cornell NanoScale Science and Technology Facility.  At
the CNF, Dave manages technology solutions (including OpenAFS) for the problems
and workflows of both users and staff. Also as part of his job, he works to
foster collaboration among the wider Cornell IT community.

Dave has a Bachelors in Computer Science from Cornell University in Ithaca, New
York.

Dave has been a member of the OpenAFS community for some time, with his
involvement in the OpenAFS newsletter, previous iterations of the OpenAFS wiki,
and writing the OpenAFS Tokens gui application for Linux and for Mac. Dave is
looking forward to continuing to work with the OpenAFS community.

### Daria Brashear (09/2012 - present) ###

Daria Brashear has been involved with OpenAFS since its inception.  As a
student at Carnegie Mellon in the 1990s, Daria took an interest in the
distributed computing environment to which Daria had been newly exposed, which led
to the acquisition of a used Sun workstation that, in turn, resulted in Daria's
current role.

While working as a student, and then a staff member as a sysadmin and
programmer for the Computing Services Division of Carnegie Mellon University,
Daria pushed IBM Corporation regarding pieces of AFS technology that Daria felt
were legally required to be distributed.  While these pieces were eventually
distributed openly, IBM ultimately chose to open source AFS completely,
coincident with their end of life announcement, and Daria was one of the
original organizers of the OpenAFS organization, as well as an OpenAFS
gatekeeper and a member of the Council of Elders since the beginning.

Daria has worked for Carnegie Mellon University, Sine Nomine Associates, and
Your File System Inc., providing OpenAFS support and development among other
responsibilities.  At Your File System, Daria currently works
on distributed data sharing technology based on protocols that, to this day, are
derived from the original AFS3 implementation and principles dating back to the
1980s.  Daria believes that these principles are ahead of their time and still relevant to
modern data consumers. Thus, Daria seeks to continue to enhance this technology in order
to bring it to ever more users.

### Todd DeSantis (09/2012 - present) ###

Todd DeSantis is a Senior Systems Support Engineer for IBM Corporation.  Todd
has been working with AFS since he joined the Transarc Corporation in 1993 as
an AFS Support Representative.  Through the years Todd has expanded his role
within the AFS Support Team to include support, development and management of
the technical direction of the AFS Developers Team.  Todd and his Team support
both IBM AFS and OpenAFS platforms.  He joined the OpenAFS Elders in 2005.

Todd can be reached at <atd@us.ibm.com>.

### Thomas Keiser (09/2012 - present) ###

Thomas Keiser has, throughout the past eight years, been closely involved with
OpenAFS development and AFS3 protocol standardization.  During his tenure with
Sine Nomine Associates, Thomas developed the Demand Attach File Service, a
technology that: 1) reduces file server restart time by several orders of
magnitude, 2) alleviates a significant bottleneck intrinsic to the wire
protocol, and 3) improves the safety of file server metadata.  In addition,
Thomas has been a prominent contributor to the AFS3 protocol standardization
process, where he authored drafts related to: low-level wire protocol
primitives, historical documentation of the existing wire protocol, as well as
proposed new features requiring protocol modifications.

Thomas holds a bachelors of science in computer science from Penn State
University.  His research and publications primarily focus on autonomous,
distributed systems; distributed control; and sensor networks.  While recently
embarking on a new career as an Illumos kernel engineer with Nexenta Systems,
Inc., Thomas remains committed to the theoretical first principles exemplified
by the AFS3 protocol.  He believes that &mdash; notwithstanding twenty-five subsequent
years of technical innovation &mdash; the balance of management, interoperability,
cache consistency, and geographic distribution features, as uniquely embodied
in the AFS architecture, render AFS peerless.

Thomas can be reached at <tkeiser@gmail.com>.

### Roman Mitz (09/2012 - present) ###

Roman Mitz, Jr., is the Senior Manager of the Systems Development group inside Computing Services at Carnegie Mellon University.  His experience with AFS started in 1996 as a user, 2003 as an administrator, and he joined the OpenAFS Elders (a group informally organized to further OpenAFS) in 2010, where he is currently the treasurer.
Roman received his BS in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon while working full-time as the lone IT administrator in the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition.  His lengthy experience at Carnegie Mellon as an IT professional spans a variety of departments and roles; in addition to those already mentioned, he was the Senior UNIX Systems Administrator for Electrical and Computer Engineering, Senior Research Systems Programmer for the Middleware team in Computing Services, and Server Systems Manager/Acting IT Director for the Carnegie Mellon Qatar Campus.  At the Qatar campus he was instrumental in the setup and operation of its complex computing environment from its opening in 2004 to his return to the United States in 2007.

Roman can be reached at <rmitz@cmu.edu>.

### Elisabeth Margarete Ziemer (09/2012 - present) ###

Elisabeth Margarete Ziemer, Ph.D., (who prefers to go by her middle name, "Margarete") is co-founder and CEO of Sine Nomine Associates, a
vendor-neutral research and engineering consultancy dedicated to objectively
identifying and implementing the best solution for each client.  Margarete, a
