## AFS3 Standardization Group ###

The AFS3 Standardization Group defines network protocols and other standards related to the AFS3 protocol family. The [AFS assigned numbers registry](http://registrar.central.org/) is used to track various protocol constants to promote interoperablity. The group operated under a Provisional Charter by community consensus since August 3, 2010. Their work is done primarily on the [afs3-standardization mailing list](https://lists.openafs.org/mailman/listinfo/afs3-standardization). Participation is open to all interested parties.

The current co-chairs of the AFS3 Standardization Group are Jeffrey Hutzelman <jhutz@cmu.edu> and Michael Meffie <mmeffie@sinenomine.net>.

On March 5, 2014, the Standardization Group announced the afs3-rxgk draft has been promoted to AFS3 experimental status. Heart-felt congratulations and thanks for this achievement.  You can learn more about their work and its progress on the [Standardization Group's page](http://afs3-stds.central.org/).
    
    
    
At present, no other initiatives are under way.  If you would like to begin a new initiative, please let us know.
