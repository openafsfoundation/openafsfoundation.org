## The community of OpenAFS experts and developers ##

The OpenAFS Foundation adopts a three-fold mission:

    To attract and increase the community of OpenAFS users
    To foster the OpenAFS community of experts
    To nurture and evolve the OpenAFS technology.

We expect our activities for accomplishing our mission to be diverse, but our vision includes that the OpenAFS Foundation facilitate the following:

In order to foster the OpenAFS community of experts and developers, The Foundation intends to:

    1) Seek contributions in both skills and talent (mentoring, conference presentations, publications, etc.)
    2) Educate member of the OpenAFS community of experts (Hackathons and/or paid internships such as "Google Summer of Code," low-cost conferences, low-cost Best Practices Practices Workshops, free-of-charge ad-hoc consulting/training via the OpenAFS ticketing system which records and archives any technical issues and/or questions posted along with their answers, etc.)
    3) Model and foster a spirit of cooperation and professionalism (mentoring, free-of-charge mailing list contributions, free-of-charge ad-hoc consulting/training via the OpenAFS ticketing system, etc).
